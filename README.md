# Advent of Code 2025

I chose to do this years AOC2025 mainly in F#, as I'm looking to learn functional, (and I couldn't get opam working... but I low key find F# much more tame).
I will also do some solutions in the following:
- OCaml (if opam........)
- C/C++
- Rust
- Java
- Python

Feel free to look through any of these for referencing!
